Lets write it down the example

 (2 -> 4 -> 3)
 (5 -> 6 -> 4)

seems like  we can use one loop to iterate through the two link list at the same time
but in case of different length of link lists, we need to check if node is Null each time when we jump to the next node

In the second situation when the sum of two digits is greater than 10, we just need the reminder of the sum and use a variable to carry digit 1 to the next 
node or nodes.
